    * Use - https://storefront.dev.gscdigital.com.br/

### Report files
* Cypress automatically generates test reports when running in headless mode (cypress run). On failures, it captures screenshots and videos to help debug issues. These files are saved under cypress/screenshots/ and cypress/videos/. You can customize reports and configure folders and formats in cypress.config.js. This makes test evidence clear and easy to maintain.
* Weâ€™ve customized the process to store screenshots in unique folders named with the current date, improving traceability
